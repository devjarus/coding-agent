## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-08

First public release.

### Architecture

- **5 agents, 1 level deep** — orchestrator, architect, implementor, evaluator, debugger
- **54 specialist skills** across frontend, mobile, backend, data, infra, and practices domains
- **7 MCP servers** — context7, exa, deepwiki, playwright, chrome-devtools, xcodebuild, ios-simulator
- **Deterministic pipeline gates** via `verify-stage.sh` script
- **Task size classification** — Micro/Small/Medium/Large with appropriate pipeline paths
- **Mandatory evaluator** after every implementor dispatch with lightweight mode for small changes
- **Reflection step** writes `learnings.md` after review PASS for cross-session knowledge
- **Human approval gates** — architect must get user approval before returning spec and plan

### Agents

- `orchestrator` (opus) — state machine, dispatches subagents, validates artifacts
- `architect` (opus) — research + design, two mandatory human gates, uses real library docs via MCP
- `implementor` (sonnet) — writes code by domain, tests first, mandatory structured logging
- `evaluator` (opus) — builds project, runs tests, tests running app via Playwright/simulator
- `debugger` (opus) — root-cause analysis when bugs survive a fix attempt
